# TestCafe Sample Base Project

Run the TestCafe end-to-end ui tests by:

```
$ yarn e2e
```

This is configured by default to run tests in chrome browsers.

```
$ yarn e2e:all
```

To run tests in chrome, Edge, IE & firefox browsers.

```
$ yarn testcafe chrome tests/filename
```

TestCafe supports chrome,firefox,safari,edge and ie browsers. The only pre-requisite is that the browser should be installed in your machine.

Tests are configured by default to run on the dev environment. In order to change that user has to set the TEST_ENV variable from the terminal.

```
$ export TEST_ENV=stg
```

Test reports can be generated by running the below command after running the tests with `yarn e2e`

```
$ yarn reports
```

The above command generates a `reports` folder where all the reports are populated.

To run the tests for debugging or during test development with the live mode (hot reload) mode:

```
$ yarn testcafe chrome tests/filename --ts-config-path=tsconfig.json --live
```
